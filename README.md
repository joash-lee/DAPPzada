# DAPPzada
Like Lazada but Decentralised Get it?

## Hi I am Joash and this is another DAPP inspired by DAPP University on YouTube

Since I am from SEA, I decided to call it DAPPzada beacuse Lazada is popular here. I will be adding more items but take note that this is merely a project to demonstrate what I have learnt about blockchain!

It is not live on any other mainnet except the hardhat test network. Purchasing the items will not give you the items in real life. Happy Shopping
